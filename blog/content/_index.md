###### About Me
Hi! I'm Owen.
I'm a reliable, helpful & professional developer with over 10 years experience developing .NET web applications in Australia, Malaysia and NZ.

Underpinning everything I do is a love of learning and sharing knowledge with others. I'm currently enjoying playing around with Blazor WebAssembly and constantly experimenting with various aspects of DevOps.

###### My Goal
Crafting readable, maintainable code and making life easier for users.
