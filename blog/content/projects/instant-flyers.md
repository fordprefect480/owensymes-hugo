## Summary

My wife came up with the idea for an application which would create flyers for [her business](https://www.carneliancraft.com.au) for the next time she participated in a local market.

MVP is to allow someone to connect to their Etsy store and download a PDF they can print off as a flyer. There will be a single flyer template available but the service will be free.

Eventually, it will:
* connect to other services
* have multiple templates to choose from
* accept payments
