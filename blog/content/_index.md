###### About Me
Hi! I'm Owen.
I'm a reliable, helpful & professional developer with over 10 years experience developing .NET web applications in Australia, Malaysia and NZ.

Underpinning everything I do is a love of learning and sharing knowledge with others. Areas that I am currently growing my skills in are DevOps and cloud infrastructure (specifically AWS and Azure).

###### My Goal
Crafting readable, maintainable code and making life easier for users.
