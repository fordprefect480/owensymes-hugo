The goals I set for myself were:
* to learn about Blazor WebAssembly, 
* keep UI as minimal as possible, and
* make as easy to use as possible.

Still tweaking as I go. My MVP was to handle the default datetime formats used by SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Application Insights since these are what I find I need to convert the most. Eventually it will recognise anything that looks remotely like a datetime.
